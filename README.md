Review of Javascript

This is not a project.  This is simply a sandbox to practice my skills in JavaScript and keep notes of my teachings and thought process through each problem I solve.

You can find some of Colt Steele and Andrew Mead's lessons in this repo.

## DOM Manipulation Challenge from Andrew Mead

1. Create a new directory called todo-app
2. Create a new HTML file
3. Create a link in JavaScript
4. Remove all p tags that have "the" in the p tags

**Create Element Challenge**

1. Write a dynamic statement showing how many todos you have left.

2. Add a p for each todo above (use text value)
